# iml

 `iml ` is an R package that interprets the behavior and explains predictions of machine learning models. <img src="https://github.com/christophM/iml/blob/master/man/figures/iml.png?raw=true" align="right" height=140/>
 It implements model-agnostic interpretability methods - meaning they can be used with any machine learning model.

## Features

- Feature importance
- Partial dependence plots
- Individual conditional expectation plots (ICE)
- Accumulated local effects
- Tree surrogate
- LocalModel: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations
- Shapley value for explaining single predictions

Read more about the methods in the [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/agnostic.html) book.

## Tutorial

Start an interactive notebook tutorial by clicking on this badge [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/christophM/iml/master?filepath=./notebooks/tutorial-intro.ipynb)

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-")
set.seed(42)
```

## Installation

The package can be installed directly from CRAN and the development version from GitHub:

```{r, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
# Stable version
install.packages("iml")

# Development version
remotes::install_github("christophM/iml")
```

## News

Changes of the packages can be accessed in the [NEWS file](https://christophm.github.io/iml/news/index.html).

## Quickstart

First we train a Random Forest to predict the Boston median housing value.
How does `lstat` influence the prediction individually and on average? (Accumulated local effects)

```{r}
library("iml")
library("randomForest")
data("Boston", package = "MASS")
rf = randomForest(medv ~ ., data = Boston, ntree = 50)
X = Boston[which(names(Boston) != "medv")]
model = Predictor$new(rf, data = X, y = Boston$medv)
effect = FeatureEffects$new(model)
effect$plot(features = c("lstat", "age", "rm"))
```
