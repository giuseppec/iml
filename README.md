# iml

`iml` is an R package that interprets the behavior and explains
predictions of machine learning models.
<img src="https://github.com/christophM/iml/blob/master/man/figures/iml.png?raw=true" align="right" height=140/>
It implements model-agnostic interpretability methods - meaning they can
be used with any machine learning model.

## Features

- Feature importance
- Partial dependence plots
- Individual conditional expectation plots (ICE)
- Accumulated local effects
- Tree surrogate
- LocalModel: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations
- Shapley value for explaining single predictions

Read more about the methods in the [Interpretable Machine
Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/agnostic.html)
book.

## Installation

The package can be installed directly from CRAN and the development
version from GitHub:

``` r
# Stable version
install.packages("iml")

# Development version
remotes::install_github("christophM/iml")
```

## News

Changes of the packages can be accessed in the [NEWS
file](https://christophm.github.io/iml/news/index.html).

## Quickstart

First we train a Random Forest to predict the Boston median housing
value. How does `lstat` influence the prediction individually and on
average? (Accumulated local effects)

``` r
library("iml")
library("randomForest")
data("Boston", package = "MASS")
rf = randomForest(medv ~ ., data = Boston, ntree = 50)
X = Boston[which(names(Boston) != "medv")]
model = Predictor$new(rf, data = X, y = Boston$medv)
effect = FeatureEffects$new(model)
effect$plot(features = c("lstat", "age", "rm"))
```
